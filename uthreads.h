 * function, and that it is called exactly once. The input to the function is

 * of the READY threads list. The uthread_spawn function should fail if it
 * would cause the number of concurrent threads to exceed the limit
 * (MAX_THREAD_NUM). Each Thread should be allocated with a stack of size
 * STACK_SIZE bytes.

 * exists it is considered as an error. Terminating the main Thread
 * (tid == 0) will result in the termination of the entire process using
 * exit(0) [after releasing the assigned library memory].
 * Return value: The function returns 0 if the Thread was successfully
 * terminated and -1 otherwise. If a Thread terminates itself or the main
 * Thread is terminated, the function does not return.

 * Return value: On success, return 0. On failure, return -1.

 * Thread tid will stop running, the calling Thread will be resumed
 * automatically). If Thread with ID tid will be terminated before RUNNING
 * again, the calling Thread should move to READY state right after Thread
 * tid is terminated (i.e. it won’t be blocked forever). It is considered
 * as an error if no Thread with ID tid exists or if the main Thread (tid==0)
 * calls this function. Immediately after the RUNNING Thread transitions to
 * the BLOCKED state a scheduling decision should be made.

 * increase this value by 1 (so if the Thread with ID tid is in RUNNING state
 * when this function is called, include also the current quantum). If no
 * Thread with ID tid exists it is considered as an error.
